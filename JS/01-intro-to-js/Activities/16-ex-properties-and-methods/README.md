# Properties and Methods

## Data Instances

When a new piece of data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the program keeps track of it in an instance of that data type. An instance is an individual case of a data type.

## Properties

The `.length` property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string. Different data types have their own properties
ex.
`let message = 'good night';`
`console.log(message.length);`
`// Prints: 10`

## Methods

Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period `.`, the method name, and parentheses. Different data types have their own methods.
ex. `Math.random();`

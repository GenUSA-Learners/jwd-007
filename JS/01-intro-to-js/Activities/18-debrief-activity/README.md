# Introduction to JavaScript - Debrief

* Start by linking your js file to your html file
* Open in browser/live server so you can see your changes in real time and notice how the code morphs the `live browser page`

1. FizzBuzz
   * Create variable `myNumber`
   * Check that the value of the `myNumber` is of type `number`
   * If `myNumber` is not a number, print 'This is not a number' to the console.
   * If value of `myNumber` is a multiple of 3 print 'Fizz' to the console
   * If value of `myNumber` is a multiple of 5 print 'Buzz' to the console
   * If the value of `myNumber` is a multiple of both 3 and 5 (ex. 15) print FizzBuzz to the console
   * If the value of `myNumber` is any other number print the value of `myNumber` to the console.
   * Reference Codecademy lessons: Introduction- Arithmetic Opertaors, Conditional Statements lessons 3, 4, 5,and 9

2. E-Commerce Item list
    * Use a swtich statement to print the price of the each item in the store to the console.
    * Ex. If the value of the variable is 'shoes' then, the statement `Shoes are $50` should be printed to the console.
    * Reference: Codecademy lesson 10

    Items:
     * Shoes- $50
     * Jeans- $25
     * Hat- $12
     * Socks- $2
     * If the variable input is not an item in the store, then print 'Invalid Item' to the console.

3. Print a random integer (whole number) between 50 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive)  to the console

# Data Types

`Number`

- Any number, including numbers with decimals: `1, -2, 99, 3.14`.

`BigInt`

- Any number, greater than 2^53-1 or less than -(2^53-1) with n appended to the number: `1234567890123456n`.

`String`

- Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`.

`Boolean`

- This data type only has two possible values â€” either `true` or `false`.

`Null`

- This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null.

`Undefined`

- This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined. It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.

`Symbol`

- A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.

**Note:** These first 7 types are considered *primitive* data types. They are the most basic data types in the language. Objects are a little more complex.

`Object`

- Collections of related data. **We'll get into these later.

At first, eight types may not seem like that many, but they are the foundation that helps programmers build a whole new world.

# Log Messages to the Console Using Variables

Work with your team to implement the following user story:

* As a team member, I want to input data about  myself and log that introduction to the console. Then I want to log a message to introduce a teammate by reassigning the variables.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I store a name in a variable called `name` and this line is logged to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

* It's done when I store a number in a variable called `siblings` and this line is logged to the console: "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_SIBLINGS` siblings(s)."

* It's done when I store a bedtime in a variable called `bedTime` and this line is logged to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_BEDTIME`."

* It's done when I reassign the values of `name`, `siblings`, and `bedTime` with my new teammate's information and the logs in the console reflect the new values.

## üí° Hints

How can we combine values using the concatenation operator (`+`) to log a single message to the console?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your team to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not?

# Conditionals

In life, we make decisions based on circumstances. Think of an everyday decision as mundane as falling asleep â€” if we are tired, we go to bed, otherwise, we wake up and start our day.

These if-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating *conditional statements*. A conditional statement checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

## Concepts

* `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
* comparison operators
* logical operators
* *truthy* vs *falsy* values
* ternary operators
* `switch` statement

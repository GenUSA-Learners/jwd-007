# üìñ Link External JavaScript File to HTML File

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create an `index.html` file and link the external JavaScript file to  to add JavaScript functionality to my static webpage.

## Instructions

1. `console.log`

	- Using the `unsolved` folder as your 'root folder', create an `index.html` file, link the `script.js` file, open the html file in the browser, and inspect the page with your developer tools.

	- You'll know your js file is properly linked when you can see the message in the console.

2. `Comments`

	- Practice commenting out different console.logs to see if you can make a coherent message in the console

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I open the `index.html` file, navigate to the console, and see the message contained in the `script.js` file logged to the console.

* It's done when the console logs a message revealing where to link the `js` file in your `index.html`.

## üí° Hints

It's best practice to add a link to an external JavaScript file above *what* closing HTML tag?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your team to further your knowledge:

* Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox. Why do you think it is so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multiline comments in Javascript?

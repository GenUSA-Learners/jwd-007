# Ternary Operator

There is a short-hand syntax for simple conditional statements -- we can use a ternary operator to simplify an if...else block.

ex.
`isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');`

In the example above:

- The condition, `isNightTime`, is provided before the `?`.
- Two expressions follow the `?` and are separated by a colon `:`.
- If the condition evaluates to *true*, the *first expression executes*.
- If the condition evaluates to *false*, the *second expression executes*.
- Like `if...else` statements, `ternary operators` can be used for conditions which evaluate to *true* or *false*.

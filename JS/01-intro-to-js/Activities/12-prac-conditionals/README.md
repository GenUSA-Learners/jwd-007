# üèóÔ∏è Use If Else Statements to Create an Algorithm

Work with your team to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate whether both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the message "True ‚úÖ True ‚úÖ" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are true.

* It's done when the message "True ‚úÖ False ‚ùå" is logged when `expression1` is true.

* It's done when the message "False ‚ùå True ‚úÖ" is logged when `expression2` is true.

* It's done when the message "False ‚ùå False ‚ùå" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are false.

## üí° Hints

Before you start writing your algorithm, do you have a plan documented in plain language that describes how you will use JavaScript to get it done?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) to research this.

# String Interpolation and Template Literals

With template literals, you can avoid the concatenation operator ( `+` ) â€” and improve the readability of your code â€” by using placeholders of the form `${expression}` to perform substitutions for embedded expressions

Work with your team to implement the following:

* For this activity you will use template literals (the adding of two strings together) to create the following sentence:

"The blind fox jumped over the playful dog."

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the sentence "The blind fox jumped over the playful dog." is logged to the console.

## ðŸ’¡ Hints

Template literals are enclosed by backtick *( ` )* characters instead of double or single quotes.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

# JS 2: JavaScript Functions, Scope, Program Flow, and Arrays

The activities beginning with 'ex' (examples) contain examples and resources for reference to use and refer to as you're working through the 'prac' (practice) activities. The `practice` folders will contain an `unsolved` folder and a `README.md` with directions on how to complete that specific activity.

**Note:**
You will ***NOT*** be using git version control in this repository. If you start using the `git add, git commit` commands, you may not be able to pull new information from the repository.

If this happens, you have to re-clone the repository.

To avoid this, it might be beneficial to work through the activities on a new branch. This way, you'll be able to checkout the main branch when you need to pull new changes, then merge the main branch into the branch you're working through your activities on.

// Create a function that will return an object every time it is called
// Copy and paste your object from the last activity "03-getters-setters"
// Add in some default properties and values that all objects will be assigned
// Use the shorthand notation for your properties who are being assigned their value from the parameter of the function
// Make sure you are returning the object from the function


// Underneath the function, create 3 different objects by creating variables set to the value of the function you created and pass it arguments.
// print your objects to the console and also test out any of the methods on them

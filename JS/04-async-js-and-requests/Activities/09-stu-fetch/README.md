# üèóÔ∏è Implement a fetch() Request to Display User Repositories

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of my GitHub repositories.

## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click the "Fetch Your User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories is logged to the console.

## üí° Hints

* How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

 - [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/api_fetch.asp)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)

* Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

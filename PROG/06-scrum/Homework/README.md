### Behavioral Skills & Mindsets for this Unit

***Personal Responsibility*** is important in Agile and Scrum because each developer is responsible for tasks that make up a greater project. Failures or achievements impact the entire project, so developers need to be aware of their responsibilities.

***Teamwork*** is important in Agile and Scrum because developers always work in teams and need to approach all their tasks having in mind how their work benefits or impacts others. Teams are there to give support to each other in order to move work forward in the smoothest way possible.
